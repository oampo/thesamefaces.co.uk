We are **The Same Faces**, an improvised comedy group based in **Leicester** and **Northampton**.  We regularly [stand on stage and make people laugh](/shows), and are constantly [training people to be funny, confident, and great communicators](/workshops). We even offer training for those of you who [have to wear a suit once in a while](/corporate).
